# It is a sample TOC file to help you get started. Fill it out with entries
# for your own content.

# Each entry has the following schema:
#
# - title: mytitle   # Title of chapter or section
#   file: /myurl  # path to file; change key to `url` if external
#   sections:  # Contains a list of more entries that make up the chapter's sections
#   not_numbered: true  # if the section shouldn't have a number in the sidebar
#     (e.g. Introduction or appendices)
#   expand_sections: true  # if you'd like the sections of this chapter to always
#     be expanded in the sidebar.
#
