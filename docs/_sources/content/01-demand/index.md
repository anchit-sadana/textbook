# Demand and Elasticities

**Student Learning Outcomes:**

* Understand basic properties of the demand curve, including movements along and shifts in the curve
* Examine different types of demand curves and their implications: non-log, semi-log, and log-log
* Use `np.polyfit` to create a demand curve from provided data
* Calculate price elasticities for demand
